make sure we can devide army equally and equal number of countries

render() call after every operation or something
Where do we enforce rules?
   current strategy:
      enforce on player
      if we want to make new type of player make sure bots, etc. don't hack
      same goes for network or user players
   potentially good strategy:
      keep track of stuff in Game()
      but we would need to store all the info and complicate logic
